def find_word(grid, word):
    """
    Searches for all instances of a word in a 2D grid, considering all possible directions.
    
    Args:
    - grid (list of list of str): The 2D grid containing characters.
    - word (str): The word to search for in the grid.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing:
        - An integer representing the number of times the word is found in the grid.
        - A list of tuples where each tuple contains the starting position (x, y) and the direction (dx, dy) of the word in the grid.

Docstrings for Each Function:
find_word function:

Describes the purpose of the function (finding word instances in a grid).
Specifies the arguments: a 2D grid and a word to search for.
Details the return type, which is a tuple: the count of word occurrences and the list of positions and directions where the word is found.
is_valid function:

Explains the function's purpose: checking whether a given position (x, y) is within the bounds of the grid.
Describes the arguments x and y, which are the coordinates of the position.
Specifies that it returns a boolean indicating if the position is valid.
search function:

Describes the function's role in searching for the word starting from a specific position and moving in a given direction.
Specifies the arguments: start, which is a tuple of coordinates, and direction, a tuple representing the direction (dx, dy).
The function returns a boolean indicating whether the word is found along the specified path.
Each function is documented with a clear description of its purpose, input parameters, and expected return value, following Pythonâ€™s convention for docstrings. This makes the code more understandable and helps others (or yourself) use and maintain it in the future.
